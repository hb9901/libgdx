### 다운로드
  Gradle로 변경되면서 더 이상 libGDX를 다운받을 필요가 없어졌습니다. 하지만 여전히 libGDX를 [공식 사이트](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html)에서 다운로드 받을 수는 있습니다.

### Documentation
The [Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) contains all the information you'll need to write a 
libGDX game. You can contribute to the Wiki directly here on GitHub!

We also provide [Javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/) online. The Javadocs are
also bundled as source Jars with every libGDX distribution for consumption in your favorite IDE.

### News & Community
You can follow the latest news about libGDX on the [blog](http://www.badlogicgames.com). Follow
[@badlogicgames](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) for real-time updates.

You can get help on our [forum](http://badlogicgames.com/forum/) and talk to other libGDX 
users on our IRC channel #libgdx at irc.freenode.net.

Another way of getting help or talking to other libGDX users is the [libgdx discord](https://discord.gg/6pgDK9F).

### Reporting Issues
Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues?page=1&state=open) here on GitHub to report issues. Make sure you read the 
[Getting Help](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help) article that walks you through
the process or properly reporting an issue.

### Contributing & Working from Source
libGDX has a strong developer community constantly improving the code base. We love to
get any and all help we can. The [Contributing](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Contributing) 
article describes the process of helping libGDX to become even better.

To contribute, you need to work with libGDX' sources directly, something normal users do not
have to go through. The [Working with the Source](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Running-demos-%26-tests)
article will give you directions.

You can also contribute financially to our infrastructure (build server, web server, test devices) via our [Patreon](http://patreon.com/libgdx)!
